# vpdbackup
script to create and apply RO and RW vpd backups on drives

there aren't many reasons you would need to use this but if you want to I guess this exists. you'll need to mount your USB to some directory prior to running the script

if you're using this in shimmer legacy, use the wifi payload and run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bromine35/vpdbackup/main/vpdbackup.sh && sudo bash vpdbackup.sh`, if you're running this in ChromeOS (dev mode) just download the script, move to /usr/local/ and run it.
